## Primitive ORM for p1
### LMMMC | Thrice the "mmm" | One plus the "magnificence" !!!  
___
###Description:
A super lightweight ORM that uses only a singular annotation
### Instructions:
In any given class that you want to create a table for, you must mark the fields you want tracked with:
> @SaveFieldMMM()

//TODO: Additional constraints on the field can also be set

That class MUST CONTAIN a zero arguments constructor

//TODO:
 -[ ] how to annotate
 -[ ] how to make server calls
