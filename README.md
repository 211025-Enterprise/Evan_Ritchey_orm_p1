# Evan Ritchey Project 1 ORM
## Light Weight ORM (LWORM)
___
###Description:
A super lightweight ORM whose design aims to use as few annotations as possible
### Instructions:
In any given class that you want to create a table for, you must mark the fields you want tracked with:
> @SaveFieldMMM()

That class MUST CONTAIN a zero arguments constructor

//TODO:
 -[ ] how to make server calls 
 -[ ] Additional constraints on the field can also be set
